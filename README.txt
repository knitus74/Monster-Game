Art assets were NOT designed to me, but are all open source.

1. Tilesets were created by Buch, and you can find more of his art on "https://opengameart.org/users/buch"

2.

3. All of the other art, like the monsters, battle backgrounds, etc... were created for the Tuxemon project by various users, which can be found here "https://github.com/Tuxemon/Tuxemon"
